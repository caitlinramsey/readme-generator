# README Generator

## Description
This application uses JavaScript, Node.js, and inquirer to generate a README.md. Once node index.js is entered into the command line, the user is asked a series of questions. Their answers
to these questions will then be inserted in the proper sections of the generated README file. For the licensing, if a license is chosen, the badge for that license is generated and put into
the README.md. If no license is chosen, nothing will be inserted. This application makes it so that a developer can quickly generate their README document and spend more time focusing on
creating their application.
